<h1>Privacy Policy — GoGas</h1>
<p>Privacy Policy</p>
<p>GoGas, operated by The Green Flame Gas Co., is committed to safeguarding the privacy and personal data of all users who rely on our application to order gas cylinders for their homes, businesses, or restaurants. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and protect the information you provide when using our services. By installing or using the GoGas app, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to the practices described in this policy.</p>
<p>When using GoGas, we may collect certain personal information necessary to provide efficient gas-delivery services. This may include your name, mobile number, delivery address, location information (when enabled), order details, and any other information you voluntarily submit through the application. We collect this data solely to process and fulfill your orders, ensure accurate delivery, improve service quality, verify identity when required, and provide customer support. We may also gather non-personal information such as device details, app usage patterns, and technical logs to help us enhance app performance and overall user experience.</p>
<p>The Green Flame Gas Co. does not sell, trade, or rent your personal data to third parties. Your information may only be shared with trusted service providers who support our delivery operations or app functionality, and only to the extent necessary to complete your order or improve the service. All such partners are required to maintain strict confidentiality and use your data exclusively for the purposes designated by our company. We may also disclose information if required to comply with applicable laws, legal processes, or to protect the rights, safety, and property of our users and company.</p>
<p>We take data protection seriously and implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to secure your information against unauthorized access, alteration, misuse, or loss. While we strive to maintain strong security practices, no method of digital transmission or storage is completely risk-free, and users acknowledge that some level of risk is inherent in electronic interactions.</p>
<p>GoGas may request access to certain features on your mobile device—such as location services—to enable accurate delivery to your premises. Granting these permissions is optional; however, some app functionalities may be limited if they are disabled. All requested permissions are used strictly for operational and service-related purposes.</p>
<p>Users have the right to review, update, or request deletion of their personal data by contacting our customer support team. We may retain certain information for legitimate business needs or to comply with legal obligations, including record-keeping or regulatory requirements. Any updates or changes to this Privacy Policy will be posted within the application and will take effect immediately upon publication.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, concerns, or requests related to privacy or data protection, you may contact The Green Flame Gas Co. through the support channels provided in the GoGas app. Your trust is important to us, and we remain committed to handling your personal information responsibly and transparently.</p>
