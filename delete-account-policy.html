<h1>Delete Account Policy — GoGas</h1>
<p>Delete Account Policy</p>
<p>GoGas, operated by The Green Flame Gas Co., provides users with the ability to delete their accounts and request the removal of their personal data from our systems. This policy explains the process, scope, and implications of account deletion.</p>
<p>1. How to Delete Your Account
Users who wish to delete their GoGas account can do so by contacting our customer support team through the support channels available in the app. Upon receiving your request, we will guide you through the verification process to ensure the security and authenticity of the request.</p>
<p>2. Data Deletion Process
Once your account deletion request is verified:</p>
<p>Your personal information, including name, contact details, delivery addresses, and order history, will be permanently deleted from our active databases.</p>
<p>Certain non-identifiable or aggregated data may be retained for legitimate business purposes, such as improving services, preventing fraud, or complying with legal obligations.</p>
<p>Third-party service providers who processed your data on our behalf will also be instructed to remove any personal information related to your account, to the extent possible.</p>
<p>3. Irreversibility
Account deletion is permanent. Once completed, you will no longer be able to access your GoGas account, order history, saved preferences, or any other data associated with your account. If you wish to use GoGas in the future, a new account must be created.</p>
<p>4. Retention for Legal and Compliance Reasons
Certain information may be retained for a limited period to comply with applicable laws, regulatory requirements, or legitimate business purposes, such as maintaining financial records or resolving disputes.</p>
<p>5. Confirmation of Deletion
After your account and personal data have been successfully deleted, GoGas will provide confirmation via email or app notification.</p>
<p>6. Contact
For questions or to request account deletion, please contact The Green Flame Gas Co. through the support channels provided in the GoGas app. Our team is committed to assisting you and ensuring your personal data is handled responsibly and securely.</p>
